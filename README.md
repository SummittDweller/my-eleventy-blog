# my-eleventy-blog

Built from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-and-deploy-your-first-eleventy-website and https://github.com/SummittDweller/eleventy-blog.  

This is my new blog for everything related to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).  

Rather than deploying [my-eleventy-blog](https://github.com/SummittDweller/my-eleventy-blog) to _DigitalOcean_, I'll probably follow the guidance from [Deploying an 11ty Site to Azure Static Web Apps](https://squalr.us/2021/05/deploying-an-11ty-site-to-azure-static-web-apps/) to host it on _Azure_.   I've used both hosts in the past, and I've been with _DigitalOcean_ much longer, but I still have some room for another "free" static app with _Azure_, so that's where I'm headed with this for now.
